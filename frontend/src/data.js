    title: "Ensuring Safe and Clean Seating Areas to Combat Dengue",
    content:
      "As a part of our commitment to creating a cleaner, healthier campus, members of the CPI Timeline have launched the Better CPI Initiative. Our first project under this initiative focuses on cleaning and securing student seating areas to reduce the spread of dengueâ€”a critical health issue in our community.

With monsoon season bringing an increase in mosquito-borne diseases, particularly dengue, our campus is vulnerable. Recognizing this, we took proactive measures to make the student seating area in front of the student union office safe and hygienic. Our project aims to not only clean these areas but also raise awareness about the importance of maintaining cleanliness in public spaces to prevent dengue.

Through this effort, we strive to inspire others to join us in keeping our campus spotless and safe. Letâ€™s all be part of the solution. Together, we can cultivate a more aware, responsible, and health-conscious student community. ðŸŒ¿

Join us in making our campus a dengue-free zoneâ€”one step at a time.",
